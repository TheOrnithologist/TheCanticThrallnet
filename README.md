The Cantic Thrallnet:

What is the Cantic Thrallnet?
In 40k lore it is an archaeotech relic used by the Adeptus Mechanicus as a neural net to mentally link soldiers with their commanding officer. As such, this is a reference tool to quickly look up 40k faction and unit rules on the fly. It is also a way for me to get more experience building applications. 

How does it work?
The application downloads faction and unit data from Wahapedia, and parses them into a local database. The UI queries the database to show you information about each faction.

Known Issues:
-Exrtaneous unprocessed HTML in some unit data
-Blue highlighted text doesn't do anything (this is from the HTML data in the import)
-Extraneous UI seperators in the Datasheet view that look wonky
-Detachments which are for Boarding Action games are not marked in a way that indicates you can't use them in a regular game

Thanks to Wahapedia for making this possible.
